Payroll is a system a company uses to manage the money it pays to its employees.

## Description
This dashboard detailed analysis of the payroll for employees for the period of January. It includes the hours worked, overtime hours, and the total pay for each week, culminating in the total monthly pay for each employee. This helps in understanding the distribution of work hours, the effect of overtime, and the overall compensation provided to the employees for the given month. Hence, it provides insights into employee compensation, enabling the company to ensure fair and timely payments while identifying areas for improvement, such as overtime and bonuses.

### Objective
The primary objective is to create an employee payroll system with data on employee names, hourly wages, and hours worked during the month of January. 

### Instalation
- This dataset is a subjective data that will be used for this analysis.

### Process
- Step 1 : Created a subjective or quantitative dataset with the value being Name, Hour-worked, Overtime-pay, weekly-pay, Bonus, Total-pay as well as Maximum, Minimum and Average.

- Step 2 : I formatted all the data into tables, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, by correcting any errors and inconsistencies within the data.

- Step 3 : I analysed the data to create meaningful insights, such as the top 10 highest goalscoring players, the top 10 highest scoring nations, etc. I did this by using a range of data analysis skills, such as VLookups, Excel Functions, and Pivot Tables.
