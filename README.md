- Step 1 : Created a subjective or quantitative dataset with the value being Name, Hour-worked, Overtime-pay, weekly-pay, Bonus, Total-pay as well as Maximum, Minimum and Average.

- Step 2 : I formatted all the data into tables, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, by correcting any errors and inconsistencies within the data.

- Step 3 : I analysed the data to create meaningful insights, such as the maximum minimum and average wage of each employee over the period of january and overal compensation provided to employee etc. I did this by using a range of Excel Functions such as IF condition, Absolute and Relative cell referencing, SUM, MAX and AVRA function etc.
